## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 47, 86%, 62% (approximately #F0D96A). This vibrant yellow evokes optimism and cheerfulness, mirroring the uplifting nature of the app's content.
- Background color: HSL 47, 22%, 95% (approximately #FAF7EE). A very light tint of yellow creates a warm and inviting backdrop that does not distract from the content.
- Accent color: HSL 17, 74%, 54% (approximately #F08234). The saturated orange hue creates contrast, focusing attention on important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, which is appropriate for headlines and body text.
- Use flat, simple icons that are easily recognizable and complement the vibrant color scheme.
- Implement a card-based layout with clear sections for featured categories, trending content, and search functionality.
- Subtle animations and transitions for a smooth user experience. Use animations on hover states, content loading, and search interactions.
